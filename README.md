I’m a terrible procrastiworker (thank you [Jessica](http://jessicahische.is/aprocrastiworker)). I’ll put things off forever if I can, in favour of working on pleasant distractions. In an effort to confront this problem, I’m undertaking an experiment and opening up my writing process here.

These are working drafts, in progress. Though I strive for accuracy, these are production files that are yet to be edited and proofed.
