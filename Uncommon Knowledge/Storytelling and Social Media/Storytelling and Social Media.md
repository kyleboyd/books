Storytelling and Social Media
=============================

This is not a ‘how to’ book on becoming a ‘social media expert’ (or any of the other terms these specialists tend to use). It’s a book about the importance of knowing your own story, the art of telling that story in a captivating manner, and – finally – an overview of the social media landscape and a guide to some of the tools you might use to tell that story.

I explore the effect that tools like Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Dribbble, Pinterest, [Insert New Social Media Tool Here]… have on the storytelling landscape, but – and this is important – the focus is on stories first, tools second.

Wonderful, shiny new tools do not make a great maker. Tools are simply a means to an end. Tools certainly help to shape the messages you create, but – at the end of the day, when all is said and done - they remain just tools.

This is a book about stories…



##Introduction

It all started with a [Storytelling and Social Media](#) masterclass I was invited to deliver…

<!-- Hmmm, I'm not sure about this, but it does provide a bit of context for the coming together of two quite different worlds, the analogue and the digital. -->

My wife is a very talented silversmith, her work is in numerous collections worldwide, both public and private. Her work also sits on the desk of the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street, a not inconsiderable achievement. She's a maker, working with her hands; her work involves a lot of blood, sweat and tears.

I sit at the opposite end of the spectrum. I make things with pixels. I used to make things with paper, scalpels and glue, but the world moved on and now everything I do is conjured from the inside of a computer. I'm also a maker and, to an extent, I work with my hands; my work, however, involves the minimum of blood, sweat and tears.

In addition to our practice as designer makers, we are both lecturers, teaching at The Belfast School of Art. My wife teaches silversmithing; I teach interactive design. Something about the experiment with Cara's students that lead to this…

My work is largely online. Tools like Twitter, Dribble, etc. are an everyday part of my toolbox, nothing special. I see them as enablers. They enable me to share things I discover that I think others might find helpful or interesting (Twitter); they enable me to gather feedback on my work while its in the early stages (Dribbble); and they enable me to XXXX (insert number three here…).

The workshop lead to a masterclass, focused on crafts sector. The masterclass lead to the book you are now reading. Let's rewind a little, to the masterclass, which was described as follows:

> In this half day seminar, Christopher Murphy explores how craftspeople can embrace social media – tools like Facebook and Twitter – to increase audience engagement and, as a result, grow sales. Introducing social strategies used by a range of craft professionals, Christopher shows the benefit social media can offer the craft sector through adding value, building networks and ultimately driving sales.

When I read this a few months after I submitted it, it perhaps sounds a bit ruthlessly commercial: "increase audience engagement and, as a result, grow sales," not to mention the references to, "adding value, building networks and ultimately driving sales."

Yes, it's true, social media can be used to drive all of the above, but - __and this is the important message__ - the 'driving sales' part of the equation is a by-product, not the goal in itself. As Simon Sinek puts it in his excellent TED talk 'How Great Leaders Inspire Action' (better known as the 'Start With Why' TED talk):

> Simon Sinek quote here…

If you haven't seen it, you should stop reading this now and go and watch it. It's only a faction over eighteen minutes, but it will change the way you do business. You can watch it here:

If you've returned from YouTube, it's a good sign, I must have captured your attention. Good.

<!-- Briefly finish up here before moving to the next section, which builds on Sinek's thinking. This might involve a chunk of structural work between the end of this section and the beginning of the next. -->



##It All Starts With You

Sinek presents a simple but powerful model for how leaders inspire action, starting with a 'golden circle' and the all important question "Why?" <!-- This needs to be explained, briefly, here, before showing the diagram. -->

/*

DIAGRAM
Above: 'Start With Why'.

*/

Sinek explores a number of examples where great leaders have inspired action which has resulted in success. The examples he presents include Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers. What ties all of these successful examples together?

Yes, as Sinek says, they all 'Start With Why', but I'd argue there's something a little deeper at play here and all we need to do to find it, is add a further circle, and change just one letter of the diagram's title. They all 'Start With Who'. Tracking back using Sinek's model, 'What' leads to 'How', leads to 'Why', absolutely, but in every case there's a very powerful 'Who' in the middle of the circle.

/*

DIAGRAM
Above: 'Start With Who'.

Apple is intimately associated with Steve Jobs, a man whose vision, relentless creative spirit and sheer force of personality, drove a company to success, not once, but twice.

Martin Luther King is, well, Martin Luther King – a man who had a dream and whose sharing of that dream utterly changed America.

As for the Wright brothers - Orville and Wilbur Wright - one can vividly imagine a picture of two brothers, perhaps a little competitive, driving each other on until, one cloudy day at Kitty Hawk in 1903 the flying machine they invented lifted off, forever securing their places in history.

At the heart of every success lies 'who'.

Credit where credit's due, I've been telling this story for quite some time, and – in addition to the debt of building on Sinek's work – I owe an equal debt to Nicklas Persson, who, as the other half of [The Standardistas](#), helped shaped this idea, placing 'who' firmly at the centre of Sinek's model.

Together with Persson, I delivered a presentation subtitled 'Start With Who' at The Future of Web Design, London in 2010. We'd been invited to deliver a 'UX Masterclass', which – to an extent we did – but we both felt that a more important story to tell was the story of how creation, any form of creation, can be tracked back to an individual, someone with passion, a 'who' that seeps into every aspect of the work they create.

I believe around every 'who', there's the potential for a good story, let's look at that a little more deeply now.



##We Are All Storytellers

We all learn by listening to stories, the core beliefs we hold dearly have often been imparted to us through the medium of storytelling. Don't take my word for it, there's a great deal of published literature on just this very topic, not least [XXXX][#].

<!-- Stories as morality tales, that needs to come here. Hans Christian Anderson, The Grimm Brothers… All of these are stories or fairy tales, and each and every one has a 'moral' or a core tenet, a lesson. That's why we tell stories and that is how we learn. -->

Hansel and Gretel wandered into the forest, they got lost, met a witch who lived in a house made of sweets, and the rest is history. I don't want to spoil the ending because you might not have heard this particular story and I'd hate to be the one to ruin it for you… but then, I'd be prepared to bet that you have this story and, more importantly, you remember it still, to this day.

Why is that?

Why, in a world where you're bombarded with information (most of which you routinely forget), can you still remember the story of Hansel and Gretel? A well-known fairy tale of German origin it was recorded (note 'recorded', not 'written') by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812. Over 200 years ago, two centuries, and yet it 'sticks'.

The reason it sticks is the way the story has been told. I'm only touching on the idea of 'stickability' here in passing - it's important - but I'd highly recommend you read [Made to Stick - Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die](#) by Chip and Dan Heath (like the Wrights, they're brothers). It's a wonderful book that offers some valuable insight into how we can make stories 'stick' and how we can develop the art of making ideas unforgettable.

Let's return to Simon Sinek and the examples he uses: Apple, Martin Luther King, and the Wright brothers. What ties all of these examples together isn't just the 'why', or even the 'who', it's the way these stories have been shaped and told.


###Apple

Jobs' departure from Apple, and subsequent return to rescue the company he had originally co-founded, is a classic tale of the phoenix rising from the ashes mixed in with more than a little sprinkling of the prodigal son returning.

The story of Apple is deeply bound up with Jobs and his own, personal voyage. <!-- A little more on that here… Referncing, just in passing XXXX's autobiography, which paints a vivid picture of a man… captivating moments of genius echoed with equally electrifying moments of sheer ruthlessness -->

Steve Jobs, more than anything, was a gifted storyteller. The 'reality distortion field', etc. His presentations are mesmerising, you find yourself hanging on every word. When Jobs unveiled the iPod in 20XX he not only cued up its unveiling with his traditional: "There's just one more thing…" (heightening the moment by introducing suspense, again, a storyteller's art), but he also descried it using the language of stories.

When Jobs described the iPod, he painted a picture of it. This magical, new device held "1,000 songs in your pocket…." [1] It offered possibility. This approach, to tell the story of the product, was the polar opposite of the competition who describe their competing products in terms of cold, hard technical features.

You remember the iPod. You don't remember the Rio Something Or Other. The Rio Something Or Other dazzled you with technical specifications, but people aren't interested in specifications, they're interested in stories. 1,000 songs in your pocket sticks, 1,000 MB hard drives don't.

Look back through Apple's history and you see the emphasis being placed on telling the story of the product throughout Apple's time at the company. The original Macintosh, a ruthless story… carefully crafted. (You remember the Macintosh, right?) Jobs leave and, in an era under John Sculley, the magic is lost. The man who had spent his life selling sugared water [2] sadly didn't have the same storytelling gift (you don't remember the 'Centris' or the 'Quadra' in quite the same way, if, indeed, you remember them at all). Fast forward to Jobs' return and the unveiling of the iMac, a remarkably shaped, candy coloured computer that changed the company's fortunes…

You get the picture. It's all about stories.


[1] If you'd like to read a little more on how language can help shape brands, you might enjoy [The Craft of Words – Part 1, Macrocopy][#], which I co-wrote with Nicklas Persson. It's available for less than the price of a cheap coffee.

[2] The story of Jobs wooing of Sculley is a riveting read, underpinned by the irony of the fact that not long after Jobs had persuaded Sculley to lead Apple, Sculley promptly fired him. A tragedy, but one that – it might be argued – only helped to shape the Apple and the Steve Jobs narrative (years spent in the wilderness…).



###Martin Luther King

A tragedy… A gripping speaker, etc., etc.



###The Wright Brothers

Orville and Wilbur Wright… The magic in the detail, the onsluaght against failure. Everything. Everything is a narrative. That moment, when the flying machine lifts off, is a triumph in the face of adversity. It sticks.

It sticks too because of the narrative of the underdog.



##Telling Your Story

So, we know that everything starts with 'who', that who you are as a person, what you do, what your values are, shape everything you do and shape your story. We also know that how you tell your story is important, it can either stick, or not.

So, how do we tell the story?

The good news is that we're living in a time where connecting with people is easier than it's ever been before. Marshal McLuhan wrote about the 'global village' in XXXX in 19XX (you should read it, it's very good). McLuhan imagined a connected future where distance collapsed:

> Insert McLuhan quote here…

We now live in that reality. For the most part, even in the most unexpected corners of the globe, people are connected in ways they have never been before. [1] We're living in socially connected ways that we could never really have imagined before. In an age of the web (and more broadly the internet, they're not the same things, [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Are+the+web+and+the+internet+the+same+thing%3F)) we can have conversations and share our stories in much, much bigger ways.


[1] A little something about the 'digital divide' here. Talk about Opera and its work in developing nations and mobile prevalence, etc., in certain place.



##Socially Speaking

This is where we talk about FOAF and FOAFOAF, etc. About magnification of your message and reaching people you might never have otherwise reached.




##Mum, this is how… *

<small>* Being British (truth be told, Scottish), I couldn't bring myself to spell this 'Mom, this is how…', but internet dwellers will now that this title owes a significant debt of gratitude to the boundlessly talented Jessica Hische, who wrote the wonderful [Mom, this is how Twitter works…][#] in 20XX. We'll get back to that, and Twitter, shortly, but I wanted to be 100% upfront here, before moving on.</small>

In this section, which forms in many ways the core of the book, I'll be running through just a handful of the sheer cornucopia of social tools out there. A note of caution, however, before we move on. The world of social media is a world littered with dead tools, and dead spaces, abandoned by the wayside in the quest to discover, and move to, a newer and more awesome platform.

There's every chance you might be reading this and clicking on links, only to discover dead ends and emptiness. Don't say you haven't been warned.

I can't hope to cover all the tools possible, but I can do my best to cover a core set of tools and – more importantly – explore certain types of tools and the different ways these might be used to tell your story.

We'll be looking at: Twitter and Facebook (broadly all-encompassing, life-sharing tools); 

I've loosely grouped these together into clusters, this is partly to make everything a little easier to digest, it's also partly to avoid overwhelming you with an incredibly long amorphous mass of tools you suddenly need to learn. As will become apparent in the final section of this book, the magic of these tools lies in how they come together.

No one can be active on every platform all of the time (you do need to get some actual making done, right?). What you can do, however, is mix and match the best set of tools for you to tell your story. In the final section of the book, I've taken three people – who I admire, and follow - and told their stories, so you can see how social comes together in the real world…

+ Tina Roth Eisenberg
+ Oliver Jeffers
+ Mister Clarke (How about Mr Bingo? What's he up to?)

Think of the tools as being little coloured shards of glass in a kaleidoscope. You can put them together in different ways. <!-- How cool would it be to have a series of different coloured kaleidoscope pictures here? -->

####Twitter

First of all explain what it is and what it isn't, then explain the basics.

+ @replies…
+ DMs
+ RTs <!-- MTs? Perhaps saying Twitter, like all social media, has a habit of 'evolving itself', etc. -->

Too much of a good thing. A screenshot of me taking up all of Cara's screen.














	

Above all what we do as creatives is tell stories. We tell great, engaging stories
