Don’t Die On Stage
==================

A two part resource on the art of public speaking, based upon my teaching in Belfast, ‘Don’t Die on Stage’ covers everything you need to know to improve your presentation skills.

<!-- This might become a book, if I ever get the time. Until then I hope hosting it on GitHub will help others. -->

Over two inter-related sections, I explore:

‘The Build Up’ explores everything you need to know in advance of a speaking event, including: strategies for embarking upon a speaking career; the importance of knowing your audience; the art of storytelling; techniques for structuring a narrative; the importance of slides; and, finally, the importance of preparation.

‘The Big Day’ focuses on the day of the event, including: arriving early and unflustered; introducing techniques to calm the nerves; the moment you’re on; the art of delivering confidently; the importance of engaging with the back channel; and, lastly, the importance of attending afterparties and being accessible to the audience.

The Build Up
------------

<!-- A brief introduction to the section. -->


###Say, “Yes.”

The best way to get started, or to improve, as a speaker is to get as much practice as you can. Presented with an opportunity to speak, my advice would be to overcome your initial nerves and say, "Yes." Once you commit, you'll learn the skills you need and, if you're in any way professional in your approach, you'll put in the time required to make your presentation a success.


####The Humble Unconference

Unconferences – events where speakers can volunteer to speak – offer a great opportunity to get on the first rung of the speaking ladder. Unconferences offer a very low barrier to entry, the only thing holding you back from speaking at an unconference is you. Take the plunge and get started, you'll learn from the experience and you'll discover if speaking is for you.

<!-- What is an unconference? (For those that don't know.) -->


####Rising Stars

Increasingly, established conferences run 'Rising Stars' tracks to give new and upcoming speakers a foot in the door. You might not get paid to speak, but the time and effort you put in will prove invaluable.


----


###It’s Not All You

No one wants to hear a speaker drone on at length about their incredible life experiences. Of course, those incredible life experiences might be the reason you've secured an invitation to speak, but don't forget, the audience outnumbers you by a considerable margin and you need to empathise and connect with them.

Audiences like to empathise and the best way to communicate your message is to frame it in terms that an audience can relate to. By all means, share your hard-won 


####Know Your Audience

Get to know your audience. All audiences are different and all have different needs. Before you begin to frame your talk and plan it out, undertake some basic research on what the audience make up is like.


####Build Empathy

Frame your story in a manner that your audience can empathise with.

----


###The Art of Storytelling

We learn through stories. The best speakers understand this. By framing your topic like a story, you can develop it in a way that your audience can relate to.


####Learning from Narrative

Narratives have been around since the dawn of time. From the cave paintings of Lascaux to presentations using the latest presentation software, great presentations are built on a solid narrative backbone.

Familiarising yourself with the fundamental building blocks of narratives and you'll improve your presentations considerably.

<!-- More detail here, including some examples. -->


####Underlying Structure

A beginning, a middle and an end. All stories feature these basic components, and yet – surprisingly – these are often forgotten. Inexperienced presenters pull together a sequence of slides that have little or no logical sequencing. Think of how your audience is following along, lay out the story clearly.

----


###It Pays to Start With Paper

Don't start with Keynote, or PowerPoint. Start with paper. Paper's a low cost medium that allows you iterate on your ideas quickly and effectively. By building your presentation on paper, you'll get the fundamentals right, you'll add form to these fundamentals shortly, when you have the story straight.

Working on screen only allows you to see a portion of the narrative, it's very difficult to get the bigger picture.


####The Power of Post-Its

The humble Post-It Note is your friend. Post-It Notes allow you to quickly move elements of your narrative around, trying them in different orders.


####The Rough Cut

Once you have your narrative arc in place, I strongly recommend building a 'rough cut', a rough walkthrough of the presentation. Resist the urge to be seduced by transitions and other software-driven features, these are the icing on the cake, they're not the cake itself.

Building a rough cut of your presentation allows you to test its basic structure on colleagues and co-workers. If the narrative doesn't work at its most basic level, no amount of superficial software flourishes will help it.

----


###Slides Are Wayfinding for Presentations

Unless you're an incredibly experienced speaker and a charismatic presenter, use slides. Unshackling yourself from slides might seem like a good idea - enabling you to improvise around your theme and go with the flow - but, unless you're an extremely accomplished speaker with years of practice, it's not advisable.

Your slides are wayfinding for your presentation. They allow the audience members, who might have drifted off for a moment, to locate themselves quickly.


####Slides Support the Story (They Aren’t the Story)

Your slides are there to support your story, they're not a replacement for the story.


####Slide Crimes

An overview of slide crimes.

----


###Practice, Practice, Practice

Without a doubt, when things go wrong, it's often as a result of failure to practice. You need to know your material inside out and - in order to do this - you need to practice, relentlessly.


####Daniel Levitin’s 10,000 Hour Rule

Commonly attribute to Malcolm Gladwell, who popularised the term in his book 'Outliers', the '10,000 Hour Rule' is in fact the product of research by Daniel Levitin. There's no arguing with the rule's underlying logic, the more you practice, the better you become.


####Jazz Is the Teacher

Jazz isn't easy, it's extremely difficult. To be able to improvise around a theme, you need to know it intimately. All those hours spent practicing will enable you to depart from your script should it feel appropriate.

<!-- A brief introduction to the section. -->


###Be Early

Zeldman's quote…


####Planes, Trains and Automobiles

Anyone who's seen John Hughes' film 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' will know when things can go wrong they often do go wrong. Travel, especially if it involves transport you have no control over (think trains and planes), can be notoriously unreliable and it often proves at its most unreliable when you need to get somewhere in a hurry.

When booking flights, build in a cushion. Don't - unless you're hugely in demand and have no alternative - arrange to arrive at the venue on the day of the conference.

Sun Tzu asserts in ‘The Art if War’ that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. The same is true of persuasive presentations. Lack of preparation leads to failure.

Talk about the need for a beginning, middle and an end. Also, consider the importance of an opening slide, ‘What I’ll Be Covering’. (Show a screenshot of that slide?) This might fit in the section on structure?

###Quotations:

“If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.” —Woodrow Wilson

“Live an active life among people who are doing worthwhile things, keep eyes and ears and mind and heart open to absorb truth, and then tell of the things you know, as if you know them. The world will listen, for the world loves nothing so much as real life.” —Dale Carnegie, _The Art of Public Speaking_
