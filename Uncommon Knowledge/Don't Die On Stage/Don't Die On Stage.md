Don’t Die On Stage
==================

A two part series on the art of public speaking, based upon my teaching in Belfast, ‘Don’t Die on Stage’ covers everything you need to know to improve your presentation skills. Over two inter-related essays, I explore:

‘The Build Up’ explores everything you need to know in advance of a speaking event, including: strategies for embarking upon a speaking career; the importance of knowing your audience; the art of storytelling; techniques for structuring a narrative; the importance of slides; and, finally, the importance of preparation.

‘The Big Day’ focuses on the day of the event, including: arriving early and unflustered; introducing techniques to calm the nerves; the moment you’re on; the art of delivering confidently; the importance of engaging with the back channel; and, lastly, the importance of attending afterparties and being accessible to the audience.

The loose structure of the two sections is as follows:

Sun Tzu asserts in ‘The Art if War’ that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. The same is true of persuasive presentations. Lack of preparation leads to failure.

Talk about the need for a beginning, middle and an end. Also, consider the importance of an opening slide, ‘What I’ll Be Covering’. (Show a screenshot of that slide?) This might fit in the section on structure?

###Quotations:

“If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.” —Woodrow Wilson

“Live an active life among people who are doing worthwhile things, keep eyes and ears and mind and heart open to absorb truth, and then tell of the things you know, as if you know them. The world will listen, for the world loves nothing so much as real life.” —Dale Carnegie, _The Art of Public Speaking_
