Don’t Die On Stage
==================

<small>Christopher Murphy · [@fehler](https://twitter.com/fehler)</small>

A two part resource on the art of public speaking, based upon my teaching at The Belfast School of Art, ‘Don’t Die on Stage’ covers everything you need to know to improve your presentation skills. I consider the journey from novice to mastery, starting small and growing your skills, learning as you progress.

I’ve seen some highly knowledgeable people who are terrible speakers, that fail to captivate the audience. I’ve equally seen some incredibly entertaining speakers, who communicated nothing. As Scott Berkun summarises it neatly (and I might be paraphrasing his thoughts, just a little):

> Highly Knowledgeable + Captivating Speaker = A Scarce Commodity

Public speaking is a skill, and like any skill it gets better with practice. Although this content is centred on conference speaking, the core skills can be applied elsewhere: in a client or product pitch, an interview, or other presentation. 

Over two inter-related sections, I explore both ‘The Build Up’ and ‘The Big Day’.

‘The Build Up’ explores everything you need to know in advance of a speaking event, including: strategies for embarking upon a speaking career; the importance of knowing your audience; the art of storytelling; techniques for structuring a narrative; the importance of slides; and, finally, the importance of preparation.

‘The Big Day’ focuses on the day of the event, including: arriving early and unflustered; introducing techniques to calm the nerves; the moment you’re on; the art of delivering confidently; the importance of engaging with the back channel; and, lastly, the importance of attending afterparties and being accessible to the audience.

The Build Up
------------

/* I’ll be adding a brief introduction to this section shortly, for now I’m focusing on content. */


###Say, “Yes.”

The best way to get started, or to improve, as a speaker is to get as much practice as you can. Presented with an opportunity to speak, my advice would be to overcome your initial nerves and say, “Yes.” Once you commit, you’ll learn the skills you need and, if you’re in any way professional in your approach, you’ll put in the time required to make your presentation a success.

Start at the bottom and work your way up. Unconferences (where anyone can volunteer to present on a topic), or events like Barcamps and Refresh, offer valuable opportunities to hone your skills as a speaker. Start there. Start small. Soon you’ll be conquering the world. Think of this as training. You don’t head out the door and run a marathon without practice, and these events – which are largely unpaid – afford you an opportunity to develop your skills and build up the confidence required to make the step up to the big stage.

The first time you get up on stage in front of an audience can be intimidating. The good news is that it gets easier with practice. The more experience you have under your belt, the better you’ll be. The secret is practice, practice, practice (10,000 hours of practice, to be precise, as we’ll see shortly).

Speaking in public, in front of an audience, can be daunting, but like anything in life, the hurdles can be overcome with practice. Before you embark on your public speaking journey, I’d strongly advice you do some research. Take a look at how others present, not just their content, but their delivery (and, on that note, their supporting material, be it slides or other alternatives.)

The good news is that there is a wealth of knowledge at your disposal. [TED](https://www.ted.com/) offers, “1,700 Talks to Stir Your Curiosity,” (and that number, by the time you read this, will very likely have grown). There are plenty of other ports of call, too. <!-- Vimeo and YouTube are both home to… also mnetion conference websites, which often have links to past talks. -->

/*

Stress that this is practice in the macro sense (the more talks you do, the better you get), rather than practice in the micro sense (you need to have run through your presentation multiple times, rehearsing it, in order to deliver confidently and convincingly).

Speaking can be intimidating, but like anything in life, the hurdles can be overcome with practice.

*/


####The Humble Unconference

Unconferences – informal events where anyone can offer to speak – present a great opportunity to get on the first rung of the speaking ladder. Unconferences provide a very low barrier to entry, the only thing holding you back from speaking at an unconference is you. Take the plunge and get started, you’ll learn from the experience and you’ll discover if speaking is for you.

Though you won’t be paid to speak at an unconference there are other benefits, most notably a chance to get important feedback on your presentation content and delivery. If you use a hashtag for your talk (a topic I’ll explore in more detail later in this book) your hashtag will allow you to engage with your audience once you’re off stage. Use these conversations to discover other unconference attendees and seek feedback from them.

This is your chance to hear an outsider’s perspective on your presentation. How was your timing? Too short? Too long? How did others judge your content? Did they find it useful? What about your slides? Are there things you could do better with your supporting visual material?

These are all important questions and unconferences offer you an opportunity to seek answers to them.

<!-- Stress above that unconferences are free to attend, there is - usually - no ticket price. This is an important point to stress in light of the next section on ticketed events. -->


####Rising Stars

Increasingly, established conferences run ‘Rising Stars’ tracks to give new and upcoming speakers a foot in the door. You might not get paid to speak, but the time and effort you put in will prove invaluable. They can also prove the first rung on the ladder to other opportunities.

Where an unconference offers a relatively low stress environment to practice your material, 'Rising Stars' tracks are a little different.

For the most part, conferences are paid affairs. Attendees will very likely have paid to be there and they expect good quality content for their hard-earned money. As a result, competition to secure a speaking engagement on a 'Rising Stars' track is often a little more fierce. As with anything in life, it's worth putting in the effort, the returns will be well worthwhile.

Conference organisers spend a considerable amount of their time and energy putting everything together, they will want to ensure that their 'Rising Stars' speakers have what it takes to inform and entertain.

/*

Given the last few days discussion around speakers' fees, it might be an idea to link to some resources on this:

+ [Jenn Lukas on 'A Formula For Speaking Fees'](http://www.thenerdary.net/post/84544230452/a-formula-for-speaking-fees)
+ [Mark Boulton on 'What are you worth?'](http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/what-are-you-worth)
+ [Remy Sharp on 'You're Paying to Speak'](http://remysharp.com/2014/03/07/youre-paying-to-speak/)

Looking at the outline, this might need to be rethought to factor this section in (or roll it into 'Rising Stars' which doesn't 100% feel right). Possibly merge the unconferences and rising stars sections, and then add a section on paying conferences, where this is included?

I think structurally this needs to begin with a merged section on unconferences and rising stars tracks, before then moving on to explore paid speaking events. This allows for a full exploration of pricing, which can be queued up by reintroducing the idea that great speakers are hard to come by and consequently can demand higher fees. It's important to stress that, though by no means commonplace, it is entirely possible to build a supplementary income through speaking and other engagements (for example, workshops and other forms of training).

*/

###It’s Not All You

No one wants to hear a speaker drone on at length about their incredible life experiences. Of course, those incredible life experiences might be the very reason you’ve secured an invitation to speak, but don’t forget, the audience outnumbers you by a considerable margin and you need to empathise and connect with them.

<!-- Stress that audiences are for the most part behind you. They'll support you, even when things go wrong. There's a high degree of empathy in play here... This might be teased out in a later section in the second part, about 'When Things Go Wrong', which should explore the inevitable technical hiccups that occur from time to time. The audience is on your side, few enjoy witnessing the discomfort of others and, as a result, the audience will will you on and bear with you if technical gremlins rear their head. -->

Audiences like to empathise and the best way to communicate your message is to frame it in terms that an audience can relate to. By all means, share your hard-won lessons, but it's a good idea to frame these in a manner that the audience can empathise with.

/*

As a side note, mention that getting introduced by the organiser is better than introducing yourself. Reference [Yes! 50 Secrets from the Science of Persuasion](#) with regards to this. It's filled with great advice. This might be better to moved to the second section of the book 'The Big Day'.

*/


####Know Your Audience

Get to know your audience. All audiences are different and all have different needs. Before you begin to frame your talk and plan it out, undertake some basic research on what the audience make up is like.

As a professional (even one volunteering their time to speak), you have a duty to research the audience before you begin. How can you communicate effectively with an audience if you haven’t taken the time to get to know them?

I always make a point of getting to know the person who invited me, and – if possible – the wider team, before I arrive. It’s simply a common courtesy, they can then guide you on the audience’s needs and make up. In our initial discussions I drill down to discover what the audiences' interests are and what their needs might be.

You’re a professional and you should know the importance of treating your audience like the professionals they are. An average sized conference with a few hundred attendees is a room overflowing with investment, your audience have to paid to be here, in many cases travelled to attend, are often staying in a hotel, and are paying for food and drink. Every single member of the audience has invested in this and you have a duty to deliver.

I once witnessed a talk by a very talented individual (a great designer, a terrible speaker), who in the Q&A, when asked about pricing tiers for web font platforms, which had been the subject of the talk, responded, “I have no idea. You could just Google it.”

I was shocked.

This is basic preparation and is the difference between a professional and an amateur. If you’ve been paid to be on stage, you need to know your material inside and out. Not knowing the answers to simple questions due to poor preparation is not only unprofessional, it’s disrespectful of your audience (the audience who, at the end of the day, paid you to be there).

/*

Stress that the organiser is a channel to the audience. The organiser wants the most from you and will do what they can to ensure you’re afforded everything you need.

It's worth the brown M&Ms from Van Halen’s legendary rider. This was less a case of a penchant for brown M&Ms and more a filter to see had organisers actually read the rider.

*/

Basic facts to check, include:

+ What is the organiser's vision for the conference?
+ How many people will be there?
+ Are attendees paying to attend? If so, how much?
+ Who comprises the audience and what might they want to hear about?
+ Basic PA questions: screen, audio, etc.
+ Will this be run off of my laptop or your system? <!-- Regardless, always pack your adaptors. -->
+ Will I have a screen on stage to see the current slide? <!-- A ‘courtesy monitor’. -->
+ Will the talk be recorded?

Whilst we’re on the topic of organisers, don’t forget to thank the organisers for their hard work. At large conferences, there’s a lot that goes on that you very often don’t see, before, during and after the conference. (Think of the proverbial swan: graceful on the surface, frantic below the surface.) A conference organiser’s job is a thankless one, and a bit of appreciation goes a long way.

Don't be a prima donna, be sure to thank everyone that's involved in ensuring your experience is a good one. From the people who are running your slides and wiring your mic, to the volunteers who are helping attendees, a lot of work goes into ensuring everything is just right. A thank you to all of these hard workers goes a very long way and is, after all, a common courtesy. 


####Build Empathy

Frame your story in a manner that your audience can empathise with. /* There are some very good points on this in Nancy Duarte's 'Guide to Persuasive Presentations' (on HBR). */

One technique is to start with a question. Take your cornerstone point and frame it as a question for the audience. For example, in a presentation titled 'Ideas Factories', on innovation and where good ideas come from, I might begin with a series of questions, designed to get the audience thinking. <!-- Do I want to use personal examples? Think this through. -->

Somewhere we need to cover the size of the audience. It might be five people in a boardroom, fifty people in a seminar or five hundred people in an auditorium... Each will have its own dynamic and demand a different approach. Five people might require more one-to-one interaction, a group of fifty will have a different dynamic, but that doesn't mean you can't interact... The larger the audience the harder it gets.



----


###The Art of Storytelling

We learn through stories. The best speakers understand this. By framing your topic like a story, you can develop it in a way that your audience can relate to.

Since the dawn of time we’ve been telling stories, stories are how we learn as humans. The cave paintings at Lascaux tell us stories of majestic hunts fraught with danger, but filled with excitment. We don’t need to have been there to understand the story, they communicate clearly.

Hold that thought. (Communicate clearly.)

To tell your story you need to know your story. It’s feels absurd writing it, but as an educator who has suffered through countless presentations that drifted and rambled with no real point, trust me…

Mention that, by and large in my experience, academics are terrible at this. They seemingly over-compensate for fear and a lack of intelligence by over complex words. Don’t use ‘obfuscatory’ when ‘unclear’ will do. There’s nothing clever about it, indeed, it’s really rather idiotic.

Reference some storytelling theory… The Hero’s Journey, etc., Freytag’s pyramid. If you understand how stories work at a basic level, you can structure your presentation more effectively. At this point introduce some of Nancy Duarte’s diagrams. Connecting with the audience, defining a shared problem, and then solving that problem.


####Learning from Narrative <!-- Once Upon A Time -->

Narratives have been around since the dawn of time. From the cave paintings of Lascaux to presentations using the latest presentation software, great presentations are built on a solid narrative backbone. <!-- Three 'presentations'. -->

Familiarise yourself with the fundamental building blocks of narratives and you’ll improve your presentations considerably.

/* More detail here, including some examples. This is where we need to explore Freitag's Pyramid, etc., also Shakespearean act structures, etc. There's a lot of good theory here, most of it can be diagrammed. Explore that, considering diagram styles, etc. */


####Underlying Structure

A beginning, a middle and an end. All stories feature these basic components, and yet – surprisingly – these are often forgotten. Inexperienced presenters pull together a sequence of slides that have little or no logical sequencing. Think of how your audience is following along, lay out the story clearly.

----


###It Pays to Start With Paper

<!--

I don’t recommend launching Keynote, PowerPoint or your visual aid of choice at the beginning. It’s much more important to know what it is that you want to say then, later, give that form.

-->

Don’t start with Keynote, or PowerPoint. Start with paper. Paper’s a low cost medium that allows you iterate on your ideas quickly and effectively. By building your presentation on paper, you’ll get the fundamentals right, you’ll add form to these fundamentals shortly, when you have the story straight.

Working on screen only allows you to see a portion of the narrative, it’s very difficult to get the bigger picture.


####The Power of Post-Its

The humble Post-It Note is your friend. Post-It Notes allow you to quickly move elements of your narrative around, trying them in different orders.


####The Rough Cut

Once you have your narrative arc in place, I strongly recommend building a ‘rough cut’, a rough walkthrough of the presentation. Resist the urge to be seduced by transitions and other software-driven features, these are the icing on the cake, they’re not the cake itself.

Building a rough cut of your presentation allows you to test its basic structure on colleagues and co-workers. If the narrative doesn’t work at its most basic level, no amount of superficial software flourishes will help it.

----


###Slides Are Wayfinding for Presentations

Unless you’re an incredibly experienced speaker and a charismatic presenter, use slides. Unshackling yourself from slides might seem like a good idea - enabling you to improvise around your theme and go with the flow - but, unless you’re an extremely accomplished speaker with years of practice, it’s not advisable.

Your slides are wayfinding for your presentation. They allow the audience members, who might have drifted off for a moment, to locate themselves quickly.

If you’re hugely knowledgeable, supremely confident and a highly entertaining speaker, by all means forego slides. If that’s not you, however, or you don’t have all three of these qualities, you need to use slides.

I recently sat on an interview panel, considering a number of well-qualified applicants. Our final interviewee of the day arrived… etc. No slides. We were lost. Without the slides as a skeleton the interviewee routinely drifted off-topic and, not to beat around the bush, bored the panel. With no slides for the interview panel to refer to it was extremely difficult to get a sense of where in the presentation we were.

It was an interminable twenty minutes of my life that I’ll never reclaim, however, I did leave with one useful note from my margins: ‘Slides Are Wayfinding for Presentations’.

Just as a well-designed building is clearly signposted taking you on your journey, so to your slides, etc., etc.

Amplify this point.

Also, in passing stress, that slides also divert the gaze. They give the audience something to look at, so that you don’t suffer a thousand eyeballs burning into your very soul.


####Slides Support the Story (They Aren’t the Story)

Your slides are there to support your story, they’re not a replacement for the story.


####Slide Crimes

An overview of slide crimes.

+ The 500 word slide…. We’ve all seen them, usually nestled in a ‘Death by PwerPoint’ presentation. It looks terrible and you just know when you see it that it’s going to be read out for you, word for painstaking word. Keep it tight. If the quote you really need to use is long, break it over a couple of slides. Think of how your audience are digesting your content, they’re seeing the presentation for the first time, the 500 word slide is intimidating and offputting.

Know your stuff… There’s a great idea here [1] on the idea of having two presentations: your actual slide deck and a ‘notes’ deck. This allows you to practice anywhere. Have your notes deck on your phone and you can be rehearsing on the bus, etc.

----


###Practice, Practice, Practice

Without a doubt, when things go wrong, it’s often as a result of failure to practice. You need to know your material inside out and - in order to do this - you need to practice, relentlessly.

It’s all about practice. Speaking is like performing on stage in a theatre, the true professionals know their lines, they’ve put in so much practice that the talk is now second nature and they know their content deeply.

As noted speaker Tim Brown puts it:

> Counting rehearsals and slide keyword run-throughs, I have given my talks maybe a hundred times.
> http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-december-6/ 

I’d echo this, 100%.

It’s like jazz, when you’ve got the melodies down and agreed and rehearsed the themes, you can build around these and improvise. Knowing your content intimately enables you to unfold your narrative effortlessly, it also stops the ‘stuck in a script’ mode. A little more on that here…

Never read verbatim from a script. It’s wooden. It’s boring. It tends to be staccato. Delivered in bite sized chunks. Like this short paragraph.



####Daniel Levitin’s 10,000 Hour Rule

Commonly attribute to Malcolm Gladwell, who popularised the term in his book ‘Outliers’, the ‘10,000 Hour Rule’ is in fact the product of research by Daniel Levitin. There’s no arguing with the rule’s underlying logic, the more you practice, the better you become.


####Jazz Is the Teacher

Jazz isn’t easy, it’s extremely difficult. To be able to improvise around a theme, you need to know it intimately. All those hours spent practicing will enable you to depart from your script should it feel appropriate.


----


The Big Day
-----------

<!-- A brief introduction to the section. -->


###Be Early

Be on time, better still be early. If you’re travelling to get to the event, ensure you have enough time to get there. If you’re travelling from another city, I strongly recommend arriving the day beforehand. 

If you’ve seen ‘Planes, Trains and Automobiles’ you’ll be well aware that travel can, at times, prove unreliable. Giving yourself a buffer on your travel times will reduce the likelihood of arriving at a venue late and, as a consequence, flustered. Allowing ample time to get from A to B will ensure you arrive with plenty of time to gather your thoughts and regroup before the moment you go on stage.

As noted speaker, Jeffrey Zeldman puts it:

> Delay happens. The train is late, the flight is cancelled, the traffic is murder. Travel is the leading edge of entropy, and entropy is the universe’s final comment on the meaning of it all. If the universe is expanding and there are snow delays on Route 1, it’s not your fault that you’re 15 minutes late to the meeting, right?

> Don’t be so quick to excuse yourself. If 80% of success is just showing up, 90% is showing up early.

Show up early, you – above all – will appreciate the effort you made in doing so.

<!-- Cross reference the above with the next section. -->


####Planes, Trains and Automobiles

Anyone who’s seen John Hughes’ film ‘Planes, Trains and Automobiles’ will know when things can go wrong they often do go wrong. Travel, especially if it involves transport you have no control over (think trains and planes), can be notoriously unreliable and it often proves at its most unreliable when you need to get somewhere in a hurry.

When booking flights, build in a cushion. Don’t - unless you’re hugely in demand and have no alternative - arrange to arrive at the venue on the day of the conference.


####The Pre-Party

Also mention that there are often pre-parties before conferences and if you’ve arrived the day before you can attend these, a great way of connecting with your audience before you go on stage. I can’t stress how important this is. If you’ve connected with a number of attendees the night before they become, in your mind, champions for you and your content on the day of your talk. -->

It goes without saying that you should be polite, engaging and down to earth (the world has no need for another prima donna).

By all means have a drink or two, but bear in mind you’ll be speaking the next day and you want to be fresh.

Get back to your hotel room early and, if you’re awake (and you probably will be thanks to the adrenaline coursing through your veins) check through your slides.

The next day, one last time. Stress that you need to run through the presentation in rehearsal mode so you can see all of your transitions and builds. Always, always, always do this. I once delivered an entire presentation only discover on the second last slide, when I turned to look at my slides, that I’d mistakenly applied Apple’s ‘anvil’ effect to every single slide.

----


###Breathe the Room

Try to get to the venue early.

Some tips on calming the nerves before going on stage. Breathe the room… etc.

Stand at the front, if there’s a coffee break before you’re on or if you’ve arrived early enough, get on to the stage and get a feel for it. I can’t stress this enough, even with no one in the room, it’s helpful to have got the feel of standing on the stage, it will make it less intimidating when you go on.

It’s natural to be nervous. Flight or flight. But remember, if you’ve done all of the above, you’re well-prepared and that preparation will pay off.


####Getting Acquainted

<!-- What is this??!! -->

  
####Turn Nervousness Into Excitement


----


###You’re On

This can be a little nerve-wracking. You’ve paced back and forth endlessly going over your talk on loop. You get the call, deep breaths. Remember, breathe the room.

Turn your nervousness into excitement.

Still head, shaky head…

You’re in charge. As the speaker you’re now in control, you have considerable power (use responsibly, etc.). If you’re in the graveyard slot right after lunch… get the audience to stand up, etc. Also, move them around (the Berkun stuff), cluster them.

You’ve been allocated to speak in Track 2, and everyone’s in the main conference hall hearing Malcolm Gladwell in Track 1. Oh dear. All is not lost. Yes, your audience might be decimated, but that doesn’t need to mean the end of the world. The people sitting in front of you paid to be here, treat them with the respect they deserve. They came to be entertained and to learn, just because there’s only ten of them, doesn’t mean you give up.


####You’re in Charge

Scott Berkun covers this well and he provides a lot of great advice.


####Use the Stage

Own the stage. Don’t hide behind the lectern. Move a little, let go.

----


###Delivery

When it all comes together, great content and great delivery leave their mark on the audience.


####Rhetoric

Watch any politician and you’ll see rhetoric in play. Repetition, alliteration, the rhetorical question, the power of the carefully held pause… All are rhetorical techniques, and all can be learned.

<!-- Run through some fundamentals here. -->


####The Body

Your body communicates, as much as the words you use and the slides that support you. Learning to control your body and use it to your advantage will improve your speaking skills immeasurably.

Body language is important. How you use your hands to connect with the audience is important and is a skill that can be learned. Similarly, eye contact makes a great deal of difference.


----


###Engaging With the Back Channel

<!-- Define what the ‘back channel’ is and how it’s changing the relationship between the speaker and the audience. -->


####It’s Not Over When It’s Over

You might be breathing a sigh of relief now that you’re off stage and, “it’s over,” but the reality is that your work isn’t over… yet. Once you’ve gathered your thoughts and, should you need it, taken a much-needed breath of fresh air, it’s time to check the back channel and engage with your audience.

Even if your talk allowed for a Q&A, there are likely to be audience members who, for whatever reason, prefer to engage with you directly via social media. Now is the time to connect with this audience and ensure that they are well looked after.

Questions shared via Twitter or other channels often have relevance to other members of the audience, so be sure to open out the discussion in a way that offers value to others. The lively debate that often takes place via social media after the presentation is over, is of value to the audience, it also allows you to share additional references - key points, books or links - that you might not have had the opportunity to include in your presentation (or, let’s be honest, overlooked or forgotten to mention).

Engage with positive comments and thank the audience members who took the time to share their kind appreciation with you. Saying ‘thank you’ – two simple words that are often, sadly, neglected – means a great deal. It sends out a message that you’re human and, more importantly, that you’re a professional who isn’t above the conversation.

Sadly, feedback isn’t always great, but that’s no reason to give up and get depressed. Engaging with your audience via the back channel shows that you’re prepared to take on board feedback – both good and bad – and continue the discussion constructively. (The key word in the preceding sentence is ‘constructively’.)

Twitter can often unleash the worst in people, who hurriedly fire off off-the-cuff criticism. The world is comprised of people with often differing viewpoints, that’s fine, it’s what makes life interesting. Just because someone disagrees with your point of view, doesn’t mean you need to descend into a battle of wills in a public forum.

Address criticism constructively, politely making your point. You might not win every audience member round, but that’s fine. Equally, some of the points you expressed on stage might have been expressed unclearly. Now is the time to express your opinion, and offer any clarification where it’s needed.


####Twitter

Though there are many avenues through which a back channel discussion can take place, Twitter is, without a doubt, one of the most popular.

Put some thought into how you can gather feedback around your presentation topic. One way of doing this is through a considered hashtag for your presentation. Most conferences will have their own hashtag, but that doesn’t mean you can’t provide a hashtag for your talk, to allow you to respond to feedback specifically aimed at you, in response to your presentation.


----


###The Afterparty

With your presentation over and a managed discussion via the back channel concluded, one thing often remains: the afterparty.

You need to connect with the audience. Don’t be the speaker who hurries in, delivers the talk, and hurries away the moment the Q&A is over. No one likes a prima donna, have a little humility and remember, you too were once an everyman. Racing off the moment ‘your work is over’ sends out a terrible message, one of aloofness.

A good presentation is often just the beginning, it’s a conversation starter. Those conversations can, and should, unfold over coffee, lunch or, later, at the afterparty. Be approachable, don’t be the stiff speaker in the corner that sends out an unspoken message that they’d rather be anywhere than at the afterparty.

If it’s a paid conference, attendees will have paid to be there, often considerable amounts (the conference ticket, travel, accommodation, food and drink… it all adds up). Treat them with respect and be polite and courteous. With luck your mother and father brought you up well and you have no need to be reminded of this.

In short, be accessible and, importantly, communicate that you’re accessible. I feel privileged to have spoken at many conferences alongside some stellar speakers. I’ve seen speakers who understand the importance of connecting with others and generously giving their time; I’ve also seen speakers who communicate that they’re only at the afterparty to tick a box and plan on getting out as fast as possible.

Don’t be the latter, be the former. They’re, for the most part, better humans. We all started out small at some point, it’s best not to forget that. Hubris is a tiny word that has toppled some great leaders.


####Connecting with People

Audience members that enjoyed your talk will often want to connect you in the informal settings of the afterparty. Be open and receptive to them. 


####Thank You

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, say ‘thank you’ (you’ll see this is a recurring theme). Before leaving, be sure to thank the organisers, they will have put in a great deal of work behind the scenes and by now are probably exhausted.

When a conference comes to an end

Sun Tzu asserts in ‘The Art if War’ that every battle is won or lost before it is fought. The same is true of persuasive presentations. Lack of preparation leads to failure.

Talk about the need for a beginning, middle and an end. Also, consider the importance of an opening slide, ‘What I’ll Be Covering’. (Show a screenshot of that slide?) This might fit in the section on structure?

###Quotations:

“If I am to speak for ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.” —Woodrow Wilson


“Live an active life among people who are doing worthwhile things, keep eyes and ears and mind and heart open to absorb truth, and then tell of the things you know, as if you know them. The world will listen, for the world loves nothing so much as real life.” —Dale Carnegie, _The Art of Public Speaking_

<!--

Carnegie is rightfully acknowledged as one of the world’s most insightful public speakers. This advice – to absorb everything from the world that surrounds you – is well worth bearing in mind. Perhaps unsurprisingly it’s echoed in James Webb Young’s excellent book, ‘A Technique for Producing Ideas’, which states:

> Every really good creative person whom I have ever known has always had two noticeable characteristics…

> First, there was no subject under the sun in which he could not easily get interested – from, say, Egyptian burial customs to modern art. Every facet of life had fascination for him. Second, he was an extensive browser in all sorts of fields of information. For it is with the advertising man as with the cow: no browsing, no milk.

The world around you – ‘real life’ – is filled with ideas that bear exploring. The best speakers often simply draw attention to this fact, highlighting the everyday and the overlooked. If you’re struggling for material to form the backbone of a presentation on a topic on which you have complete creative control, it pays to take a step back and simply absorb the world around you.

Look for the obvious solutions, you’ll be surprised that others often overlook these, in their quest for novelty. As noted business adviser, Sir Gerry Robinson, puts it: “The world is a relatively simple place, we just have a tendency to over-complicate it.”

When developing your theme, focus less on what you want to say than on what you want to learn, and share that with your audience. The best presentations are the result of individuals wrestling with their ideas and clarifying their thinking. The world is an incredibly complicated place, wrestling with a single topic and clarifying it for your audience will result in presentations that leave your audience with worthwhile advice. /* This idea, needs to be explored further. */

“A good speech should be like a woman’s skirt; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest.” —Winston Churchill

<!--

Inherent sexism notwithstanding, this is great advice from Churchill. All too often presenters over-labour the point, losing their audience as they do. In over a decade of presentation experience, which includes a sizeable period of working as an educator, I’ve seen speakers drag on for what seems an eternity.

The longer you speak for, the harder it is for your audience to concentrate. Bear that in mind when you plan your presentation. 40-45 minutes, in my experience, hits the sweet spot. It’s long enough for you to thoroughly explore a topic, without dragging on so long that you lose the audience.
