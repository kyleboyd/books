###Introduction

Nobody’s listening any more. Your marketing budget is – more often than not – wasted, and your advertising budget? Well, as William Lever famously put it, “I know half my advertising isn’t working, I just don’t know which half.” [1]

In the face of rapidly diminishing attention spans, and a life increasingly being spent on the move amidst faces buried in the glowing screens of mobile devices, how do you get people to pay attention and start talking again? How do you get the word out, in a manner that sticks? You’ve got an exciting new product or service. Great. But how are you going to let people know?

I believe one way is to ensure your product or services is ‘talkaboutable’, inherently interesting. (Seth Godin would call this ‘remarkable’, and I’d urge you to read his remarkable book Purple Cow, which explores this very topic.

Talkaboutability captures an emerging way we need to think about marketing and promotion. Rather than adopt an old model, advertising to the middle of Rogers’ ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ (focusing on the early and late majority), we need to connect with the leading edge of the curve (focusing on the innovators and early adopters). Twinned with this shift, we need to consider ways and means of making our products talkaboutable (what Godin terms ‘remarkable’ in his excellent book [‘Purple Cow’](#)).

We can target the thought leaders and get them sneezing, and that’s a great idea, but we can also ensure that what we create - whether it’s a product or a service - is inherently talkaboutable. Hugh MacLeod talks about the need to create ‘social objects’, Seth Godin talks about ‘purple cows’. What are these exactly, and how can we learn from them?

In this, the first of a series of Tiny Books, I’ll introduce and explore a number of strategies to ensure you or your product are talkaboutable. I’ll also explore a series of case studies, highlight strategies – large and small – that have worked.

Buckle up for the ride, let’s get started.

###Talkaboutability

__This is the heart of the book, it needs considerable expansion.__

Set up the term, talkaboutability, and introduce it, then go on to expand on it in the subsections we’ll be having. I think this section could offer a light overview - offering a few sentences on each of the subsections, so the reader knows where we’re going.

I need to do a little thinking here, to get my thoughts in order, but essentially the book is about how we communicate and how that’s changing. I have a feeling that this will break down into seven key sections, which will form the backbone of the book. I’d like the books to all follow a common pattern, to make them easier to produce across the board, and seven chapters feels about right, worth the price we’re pitching at.

I’ll probably return to this section once the other sections have more clearly shaped up. Having spent a day, and now most of a night, writing this, I’m getting clearer on where I think I’m heading.


----


###The End of the Mad Men Era

The tried and tested models of the Mad Men era no longer work as effectively as they used to. Attention spans are shorter and as they atrophy we need to rethink how we approach marketing. We need to rethink how we get ideas out there, how we ensure they take hold and capture mindshare.

Don Draper might have worked his debonair magic in the fifties, when narratives around ‘The Carousel’ channeled a need for nostalgia, but we’ve moved on a long way since then. Over half a century later, tempered by cynicism, we’ve been weaned off nostalgia and are deeply suspicious of the media landscape.

We accelerate through adverts, watching them on fast forward, or our set top boxes enable us to forego them completely. In the face of this, we need to find new ways to connect with audiences, truly engaging with them so that the messages we communicate have a chance of surviving in an onslaught of information overload.

This first section provides a little context, looking at (and learning from) history. It will look at how the model of communication has changed, going from one to one, to one to many, to many to one, and – finally – many to many.

We’ll consider three ages:

+ The Age of the Agora
+ The Mad Men Era
+ The Connected Era

This is best captured in a diagram that shows three patterns of communication, that map onto the above: one to one (the era of the agora); one to many (the era of advertising); and many to many (the connected era we live in now).

Everything’s a conversation. (A theme we’ll return to shortly.)

###Time for a Little Theory (Meet Mr Rogers)

This section rewinds a little and introduces some theory, but packaged up in a digestible manner. It focuses on explaining Rogers’ ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ model, building on it. Essentially it explains the idea of how things spread.

We’ll look at Rogers’ ‘Diffusion of Innovations’, providing some context. We’ll need to redraw Rogers’ diagram. This needs to come early on. At first I thought it should come before ‘The End of the Mad Men Era’, but it feels about right here. Perhaps with a rewind, or something like, stepping back lets explore how this works…?

The section also possibly introduces Godin’s idea of ‘ideaviruses’, although I don’t want to rest too heavily on Godin, as ‘Purple Cow’ is already a heavy inspiration. It might be better to explain that Godin’s ideavirus term parallels the whole idea of memes – mental viruses, ideas that spread – which tracks back much further.

An idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture, the term ‘meme’ originated in Richard Dawkins’ 1976 book ‘The Selfish Gene’. For Dawkins, memes exemplified a non-biological, yet still self-replicating unit with potential significance in explaining human behavior and cultural evolution.

How do ideas take hold?

This section should also discuss how ideas reach critical mass and tipping points. The latter possibly opens up the opportunity to touch on some of Gladwell’s writing on this, in particular the idea of mavens:

> A maven is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass knowledge on to others. The word maven comes from Hebrew, via Yiddish, and means one who understands, based on an accumulation of knowledge.

> Malcolm Gladwell used the term in his book The Tipping Point (Little Brown, 2000) to describe those who are intense gatherers of information and impressions, and so are often the first to pick up on new or nascent trends.

> — Wikipedia

This section should really explore the science of spreadability.

####The Exponentiality of FOAFOAF…

On reflection, I think ‘The Exponentiality of FOAFOAF…’ might be better here, immediately following Rogers’ ‘Diffusion of Innovations’, so we can talk about how the reach of word of mouth has now exponentially increased. Word of mouth diffusions have always formed the backbone of how ideas spread, but word of mouth is now supercharged.

Define FOAFOAF. Talk about how, in a non-networked world, network effects are more limited, for example, FOAF or FOAFOAF. In a networked world, however, this effect becomes exponentially more powerful, for example, FOAFOAFOAF or FOAFOAFOAFOAF…

This needs a diagram that shows the exponential nature of this. We start with just one (1), who tells two (3), they tell two (8), they tell two (16), and so on:

+ Level 1: 1
+ Level 2: 2
+ Level 3: 4
+ Level 4: 8

Actually, this diagram’s a little more complicated and grows much faster when we start to consider of the effect that someone like @swissmiss might have on a message if she shares it amongst her 361,706 followers (who all have followers, and so on).

Suddenly we’ve moved beyond six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

Thanks to social and conversational media - Twitter, Facebook, etc. - our reach is extended and amplified. Mention a few folks with bazillions of followers (Tony Hsieh, for example, @zappos, using @twitter to connect with 2,806,518 people). Talk about how their reach is hugely amplified now. Talk about how influencers, sneezers, have a wider and deeper reach, thereby amplifying the network effects Rogers explored.

We live in a hugely connected era. Twitter, Facebook… Hashtags, you name it. Understanding this media landscape, telling engaging stories - connecting with people - is where the future lies and this is where talkaboutability comes in. <!-- I’m don’t think that this book is going into the mechanics of how Twitter, hashtags, etc., work. That feels a bit of a stretch and I don’t want it to become a ‘how to user Twitter’ (or other social media) guide. A link to Jessica’s [Mom, this is how twitter works.](http://www.jhische.com/twitter/) -->

Explain how there are pros and cons to this. Talkaboutability can work in your favour or it can work against you. People can spread good news, but they can also spread bad. How you react to this news can make or break you. We need som examples here, along the lines of Royal Bank of Scotland – unbelievably – having no Twitter presence when their computer systems went down, or Boots’s @bootsofficialuk account:

> Boots Customer Care aren’t tweeting but call 0845 070 8090 Mon -Fri 8.30am to 7pm, w/e 8.45am to 5pm & B/H 9am to 4pm or email boots.customercare@boots.co.uk

Oh dear. There’s a lot to unpack here, not least the fact that for many customers, service is now 24/7, not 8.30 am to 7.00 pm. What might be happening to your brand – in terms of talkaboutability – in the 13 ½ you’re not manning the phones, never mind what’s happening to your brand on the channels – like Twitter – because you, “Aren’t tweeting.”

Talk in more depth about ‘The Cluetrain Manifesto’:

> Markets are conversations. Talk is cheap. Silence is fatal.

<!-- I’m rereading this as we speak. A decade old and still great stuff. -->

There are pros and cons to our friend of a friend of a friend landscape. Our stories are amplified, both good and bad. There’s a great story about the pizza company, who took negative Yelp reviews and made T-Shirts with them:

> A San Francisco restaurant has figured out a way to wrest power from Yelp, the review site that has many small business owners feeling frustrated and voiceless.

> Pizzeria Delfina, is flaunting Yelp reviewers’ mean-spirited, one-star reviews with pride. The restaurant made T-shirts quoting bad reviews and gave them to employees to wear on the job. Now, when customers order a margherita pizza with fior di latte mozzarella, tomato and basil, their server might bring it to them wearing a T-shirt that reads: “The pizza was soooo greasy. I am assuming this was in part due to the pig fat” under a rating of one out of five stars.

This section needs a bit of work, but building out the various examples will help build a solid base of content.

###Social Objects

Next up, social objects. What exactly are they and why are they important? Read this:

	http://gapingvoid.com/so/

That previous link needs a long, hard re-reead as I think my definition of this is straying from where MacLeod and Zengestrom are on this. It’s all good stuff, however, and very much in tune with my thinking.

Also this, by Jyri Zengestrom (who coined the term ‘social objects’):

	http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2007/09/wine-as-a-social-object.html

Hugh MacLeod’s idea of social objects needs to be unpacked here. This can build on the back of what we know so far. Given what we know about how ideas and innovations diffuse, and how this effect has been amplified by the FOAFOAF factor, we can apply this knowledge by ensuring that what we create has sociability baked in.

This section feels like the ideas are coming together and coalescing. This might be a good place to run through some case studies? (Though that might be a separate standalone chapter? As I wrote the case studies below they started to feel like they deserved a more substantial place in the narrative, rather than referencing them inline.) Perhaps do the social objects section first, then close on the case studies?

Explain this the way I have been to students on the MFA…. Examples would help here (and I’ve listed some below, but have now shifted them into a separate chapter with case studies). Some of the things I’ve been talking about on the MFA, in terms of social objects:

+ The Man Your Man Could Smell Like
+ Sony’s ‘Colour Like No Other’
+ Cadbury’s ‘Gorilla’
+ The Economist’s Pizza Boxes

What I really want to talk about here is how you make the ‘object’ (that might not be an object as such, it might be a service) a talkaboutable object?

This could touch on lots of different things. (Andy McMillan’s handwritten cards, for example, where do these sit? They’re talkbaoutable, they’re social, they’re shared on FLickr….) In short, there’s a lot to unpack here.

###Markets Are Conversations

Here I’ll be sharing real world stories and case studies. I’ll kick off with some introductory text, then get into the case studies. At present I have two, Old Spaice and Cadbury, I need another example that’s more recent.

+ Old Spice’s ‘The Man Your Man Could Smell Like’ (2010)
+ Cadbury’s ‘Gorilla’ (2007)


####The Man Your Man Could Smell Like (2010)

‘Smell like a Man, Man’ was a multi-platform advertising campaign developed by advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy for Old Spice in 2010. Widely known as the main character for a series of Old Spice TV commercials, Isaiah Mustafa is ‘The Man Your Man Could Smell Like’.

Here I’ll provide some background on the campaign, including exploring some of its remarkable results. I’ll outline the design of the system that underpinned the campaign and how the team behind it were careful to develop responses to everyone, from celebrities like Demi Moore, to everyday people.

There are lots of figures on the success of this campaign and they make compelling reading.


####Gorilla (2007)

An advertising campaign launched by Cadbury in 2007 to promote Cadbury’s Dairy Milk chocolate, ‘Gorilla’ centred around a ninety second television and cinema advertisement that captured the imagination of viewers and – importantly – got them talking.

The campaign, handled by advertising agency Fallon London, first appeared on British television on 31 August, 2007, but has since appeared in a number of other countries, worldwide.

Fallon’s proposal centred around the idea of stepping away from a traditional advertising approach, often focused on the product, in favour of a more abstract approach. “Their proposal was to step away from pushing the product through traditional advertising means, and instead produce ‘entertainment pieces’, which would appeal to a broader range of consumers and spread through viral marketing.”

I’ll expand on this, touching on Cadbury’s other advertising campaigns that developed these themes.

###Colophon

The typefaces – Elena for body copy, and Klavika for titling – are both designed by the talented team (Eric Olson and Nicole Dotin) at Process Type Foundry. Elena, “a serif typeface meant for extended reading,” is an exercise in subtlety and restraint. Klavika, “a do-it-all sans serif,” is unadorned, modern and infinitely flexible. Together they make a perfect pairing.

The grid system and underlying page architecture is an evolution of Bruce Mau’s evolution of Jan Tschichold’s celebrated grid system(s). A combination of Tschichold’s assymetric and symetric thinking with some slight modifications to factor in grid systems in digital media. Like all typography, it’s an evolution.
